# relay_teams_evals

Benchmark evaluation framework for agent-teams. Lives under `src/relay_teams_evals/` as part of the main project package layout. Drives the agent system through its HTTP SDK.

## Setup

The evals dependencies (`swebench`, `docker`, `datasets`) are declared as a dependency group in the root `pyproject.toml` and installed automatically by `uv sync`:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Start the relay-teams backend
relay-teams server start

# 2. Generate a config file
relay-teams-evals init-config --output eval.yaml

# 3. Edit eval.yaml (set dataset_path, scorer, workspace_mode, etc.)

# 4. Run
relay-teams-evals run --config eval.yaml
```

Runs resume by default when `output_dir` already contains `checkpoint.meta.json`
and `checkpoint.results.jsonl` for the same eval definition. Use `--restart`
to archive the previous `output_dir` and start fresh.

CLI overrides are available for quick one-offs without editing the file:

```bash
relay-teams-evals run --config eval.yaml --limit 5 --concurrency 2
relay-teams-evals run --config eval.yaml --restart
relay-teams-evals run --config eval.yaml --item-ids astropy__astropy-8707 --rerun
relay-teams-evals run --config eval.yaml --item-ids astropy__astropy-8707,astropy__astropy-14309 --rerun --concurrency 2
```

## Workspace modes

### git mode (default)

Clones the repo locally on the host, registers the clone directory as a temporary agent-teams workspace, then deletes both after the run.

```yaml
workspace_mode: git
evals_workdir: .agent_teams/evals/workspaces
git_clone_timeout_seconds: 120
```

### docker mode

Runs each eval item inside a dedicated SWE-bench Docker container. The relay-teams server starts inside the container alongside the repo. This is the recommended mode for SWE-bench.

```yaml
workspace_mode: docker

docker:
  # SWE-bench image prefix; full image = {image_prefix}.{instance_id}:latest
  image_prefix: "swebench/sweb.eval.x86_64"

  # Runtime base image -- build once before running evals:
  #   docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.agent-runtime -t agent-teams-runtime:latest .
  agent_runtime_image: "agent-teams-runtime:latest"

  # Wrapper that creates a container-local venv with uv, then starts relay-teams.
  agent_runtime_bin: "/opt/agent-runtime/bin/relay-teams"

  # Port the agent-teams server listens on inside each container.
  container_server_port: 8000

  # Path inside each eval container where the repo is checked out.
  container_repo_path: "/testbed"

  container_startup_timeout_seconds: 60

  # Host env vars forwarded into every container.
  forward_env_vars:
    - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    - HTTP_PROXY
    - HTTPS_PROXY
    - NO_PROXY

  # Verbatim env vars injected into containers (no host-env lookup).
  # Use for values that differ from the host, e.g. proxy via host.docker.internal:
  # extra_env:
  #   HTTP_PROXY: "http://host.docker.internal:7897"
  #   HTTPS_PROXY: "http://host.docker.internal:7897"

  # Auto-build missing SWE-bench instance images (requires docker + datasets packages).
  build_instance_images: false
```

The runtime image is a data container -- it is created once (`docker create`) and mounted into every eval container via `--volumes-from`. It provides a standalone `uv` binary, a uv-managed Python 3.12, and an offline wheelhouse at `/opt/agent-runtime/`. Each eval container creates its own local venv under `/tmp/agent-runtime/venv` before starting the server.

When auto-building SWE-bench instance images, agent-teams now uses the
generated `setup_repo.sh` as-is. If an instance image build fails, the run
fails during workspace preparation and surfaces the exact `build_image.log`
path instead of continuing into `docker run` retries for a missing image.

## Config file reference

All settings live in a single YAML file. Use `init-config` to generate a commented template.

## Datasets

Place dataset files under `.agent_teams/evals/datasets/` (git-ignored).

### Custom JSONL

Each record is a JSON object (pretty-printed multi-line JSON is also supported). Required field: `intent`. Optional fields:

| Field | Type | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `item_id` | str | identifier (auto-generated if absent) |
| `expected_keywords` | list[str] | keyword scorer |
| `expected_patterns` | list[str] | regex scorer |
| `repo_url` | str | git/docker workspace setup |
| `base_commit` | str | git/docker workspace setup |
| `reference_patch` | str | swebench scorer |
| `fail_to_pass` | list[str] | swebench_docker scorer |
| `pass_to_pass` | list[str] | swebench_docker scorer |

Example:

```json
{"item_id": "hello-world", "intent": "Say hello", "expected_keywords": ["hello"]}
```

### SWE-bench

Download from [SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Verified](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Verified) and save the file under `.agent_teams/evals/datasets/`. Set `dataset: swebench` in config -- the loader maps SWE-bench fields automatically.

The initial intent is rendered as a Coordinator-facing PR-style prompt built
from the original `problem_statement` content:

- HTML comments are removed
- line endings and trailing spaces are normalized
- extra blank lines are compacted
- `hints_text`, when present, is emitted as a separate `<hints_text>` block
- `FAIL_TO_PASS`, `PASS_TO_PASS`, and `test_patch` remain scorer-only metadata and are not included in the agent-facing intent

## Scorers

| Scorer | Passes when | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| `keyword` | all `expected_keywords` appear in agent output | -- |
| `regex` | all `expected_patterns` match agent output | -- |
| `event_status` | run outcome is `completed` (baseline) | -- |
| `swebench` | Jaccard similarity of generated vs reference patch >= threshold | git diff, `reference_patch` |
| `swebench_docker` | filtered candidate patch applies, `test_patch` applies, `fail_to_pass` tests pass, and `pass_to_pass` tests do not regress | docker mode, `fail_to_pass`/`pass_to_pass` |

For SWE-bench, `swebench_docker` is the recommended primary scorer. It runs `pytest`
inside a fresh scoring container started from the same SWE-bench instance image used
for the agent run. The agent container only produces a candidate patch; the scoring
container replays that patch, then applies `test_patch`, then runs pytest. Candidate
changes that touch benchmark-managed test files are filtered out before scoring and
recorded as warnings. Artifacts include the scored `patch.diff`; when filtering occurs,
the original extracted diff is also saved as `raw_patch.diff`. `patch_jaccard` is
recorded as an auxiliary diagnostic score for the scored patch.

## How workspace isolation works

### git mode

1. Repo is cloned to `.agent_teams/evals/workspaces/{item_id}/{run_hash}/repo/`
2. That directory is registered as a temporary workspace via `POST /api/workspaces`
3. The session is created inside that workspace -- the agent's file tools are scoped to the repo
4. After the run, the workspace is deleted and the clone is removed (unless `keep_workspaces: true`)

### docker mode

1. A stopped runtime data container is created once from `agent_runtime_image`
2. For each item, a SWE-bench image is launched with `docker run -d`, mounting the runtime via `--volumes-from`
3. The relay-teams server starts inside the container; the runner waits for it to become ready
4. A temporary workspace is registered pointing to `container_repo_path` inside the container
5. After the run, the workspace is deleted and the container is removed (unless `keep_workspaces: true`)
6. The runtime data container is removed after all items finish

## Output

Results land in `output_dir` (default `.agent_teams/evals/results/`):

- `checkpoint.meta.json` -- resumable eval signature (dataset/config/item set)
- `checkpoint.results.jsonl` -- append-only per-item results used for resume
- `report.json` -- full structured report (all item results + summary stats, including auxiliary scores)
- `report.html` -- self-contained HTML report with per-item table and auxiliary scores
- `artifacts/<item_id>/patch.diff` -- scored patch after benchmark test-file filtering
- `artifacts/<item_id>/raw_patch.diff` -- original extracted patch when different

`report.json` is refreshed after each completed item. If a run is interrupted,
rerunning the same command resumes from the checkpoint and rebuilds the report
from the saved results. If the new command changes the dataset, filtered item
set, scorer, backend execution settings, or workspace mode, resume is rejected
and you should rerun with `--restart`.

To rerun one or more items within an existing result set, pass explicit item ids
with `--rerun`. `--item-ids` accepts either repeated flags or comma-separated
values. This re-executes only the selected items, appends the new result
to the checkpoint log, overwrites that item's artifact directory, and refreshes
`report.json` / `report.html` so they show the latest result for the rerun item:

```bash
relay-teams-evals run --config eval.yaml --item-ids astropy__astropy-8707 --rerun
relay-teams-evals run --config eval.yaml --item-ids astropy__astropy-8707,astropy__astropy-14309 --rerun --concurrency 2
```

Token usage is recorded in detail for each result and the final report:

- `input_tokens`
- `cached_input_tokens`
- `output_tokens`
- `reasoning_output_tokens`
- `total_requests`
- `total_tool_calls`

`estimated_cost_usd` prices token dimensions only. `requests` and `tool_calls`
are surfaced as counters and are not converted into dollars.
