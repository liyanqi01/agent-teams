# relay-teams

Role-driven multi-agent orchestration framework built with strong typing and tool-only collaboration flow.
Runtime model execution uses `pydantic_ai` with OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Evaluation Snapshot

Recent SWE-bench snapshots are archived under [`docs/evaluations/swebench/`](docs/evaluations/swebench/README.md).
AgentBench OS/DB snapshots are archived under [`docs/evaluations/agentbench/`](docs/evaluations/agentbench/README.md).
Current SWE-bench snapshots cover only the first `100` items from `SWE-bench Verified`, not the full benchmark.

SWE-bench snapshots include the previously archived `glm-5` runs and the newer `deepseek-v4-flash` runs from `2026-06-08`. AgentBench uses the archived `deepseek-v4-flash` run from `2026-05-26__00-38-21`.

Highlights:

- The archived `glm-5` SWE-bench snapshots remain available under their original report filenames.
- `deepseek-v4-flash` reaches `71/100` in normal mode and `72/100` in orchestration mode on the same SWE-bench Verified 100 subset.
- In orchestration mode, `outcome` is the agent lifecycle status and can be `failed` even when the SWE-bench Docker scorer marks the patch as resolved.
- AgentBench is reported as separate OS and DB suites from the archived 444-item run.
- Token usage is reported directly in the table so model IO and tool activity can be compared without deriving cost assumptions.

## Web Interface

Start the server with `uv run relay-teams server start` and open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.
Use `uv run relay-teams server restart` to restart the managed server, and `uv run relay-teams server stop --force` to force stop it.
Add `--daemon` to `server start` to run the server as a background process: `uv run relay-teams server start --daemon`.
All CLI commands that support `--autostart` now also accept `--daemon` (`-d`) and `--force` to control background autostart behavior and force-restart an existing server.
The web UI now includes a language toggle beside the settings button so you can switch between English and Simplified Chinese in-page.

Frontend assets are now decoupled under `frontend/dist` and served by the backend.

### Temporary Public URL for GitHub Webhooks

The GitHub Webhook panel can create a temporary public URL for local testing.
This uses `localhost.run` over `ssh` and the service assigns a random temporary hostname such as `*.lhr.life`.
Users do not register the exact `lhr.life` hostname themselves.

How to use it:

1. Open `Automation -> GitHub -> GitHub Access`.
2. In `GitHub Webhook`, click `Create Temporary URL`.
3. Wait for the generated `Webhook Base URL` to be filled automatically.
4. Copy the derived `Callback URL` into GitHub's `Payload URL`.
5. Configure the same GitHub webhook `Secret` on both sides so GitHub sends `X-Hub-Signature-256`.

Notes:

- This feature requires `ssh` to be installed on the host running `relay-teams`.
- The temporary public hostname only stays valid while the tunnel is running.
- Use your own stable domain and reverse proxy for long-lived production webhooks.

## Quick start

### 1) Install dependencies

Use the setup script for your platform, install from PyPI, or install directly with `uv`.

Windows:

```powershell
.\setup.bat
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
sh setup.sh
```

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install relay-teams
```

Direct install:

Windows:

```powershell
py -3 -m pip install uv
py -3 -m uv sync --extra dev
py -3 -m uv pip install -e .
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
python3 -m pip install uv
python3 -m uv sync --extra dev
python3 -m uv pip install -e .
```

For local development, prefer `uv run --extra dev ...` over raw `python`, `pytest`, or `ruff` so commands execute inside the repository environment instead of a system interpreter.

### 2) help

```bash
relay-teams --help

# for evals
relay-teams-evals --help
```

If the `relay-teams` command is still missing in a fresh local checkout, the project package was not installed into the active virtual environment. Re-run the matching `-m uv pip install -e .` command above for your platform, or use `py -3 -m uv run python -m relay_teams --help` on Windows or `python3 -m uv run python -m relay_teams --help` on Linux/macOS as a fallback.

Examples:

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest -q
uv run --extra dev ruff check --fix
uv run --extra dev basedpyright
```
