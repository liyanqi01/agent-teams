# AO-4 Async Path Unification Spec

## Status

Implemented through the final 2026-05-01 AO-4 repository slice, with the final
2026-05-08 cleanup removing the legacy sync-wrapper helper from
`SharedSqliteRepository`. The async runtime and server persistence paths now use
native async repository operations instead of bridging through synchronous SQLite
methods.

## Context

AO-4 moves runtime and persistence paths away from async wrappers around
synchronous SQLite methods. Earlier slices migrated the orchestration hot path,
automation management plane, automation delivery queue, bound-session queue, and
session terminal-view marker flow. The final slice completes the remaining
runtime-facing repository families:

- message history and prompt persistence
- task, run, event, background task, approval, and user-question batch lookups
- external agent sessions and external session bindings
- gateway account, inbound queue, session, and message-pool stores
- workspace, SSH profile, media asset, trigger, monitor, role memory, token
  usage, and retrieval FTS stores

The issue addressed is not only blocking I/O. A wrapper-based async method can
inherit synchronous locking behavior, hide queue pressure, and make route timeout
semantics depend on whether work happened to be routed through a thread bridge.
The contract after AO-4 is explicit: async runtime paths use native async
repository operations unless the boundary is intentionally synchronous.

## Goals

- Remove the legacy sync-wrapper helper from `src/relay_teams` completely.
- Keep async repository methods on `aiosqlite`, `async_fetchone()`,
  `async_fetchall()`, `_run_async_read()`, and `_run_async_write()`.
- Preserve existing public API payloads, database schemas, state-machine
  semantics, timestamp ordering, and cache invalidation behavior.
- Preserve atomic claim behavior for automation delivery, bound-session queue,
  gateway inbound queue, Feishu message pool, approvals, questions, and runtime
  work queues.
- Add regression coverage that fails when a runtime source file reintroduces a
  sync bridge caller.

## Non-Goals

- Removing every synchronous public API method. CLI, scripts, and legacy sync
  callers may continue to call synchronous methods at deliberate boundaries.
- Changing `/api/*` contracts or database schema.
- Introducing a new database transaction abstraction.
- Replacing the session-read route-work queue or other request admission
  controls.

## Design Contract

Async repository methods must execute database work directly on async
connections. Read methods should use `async_fetchone()` and `async_fetchall()`
so cursors are closed consistently. Write methods should close cursors before
returning and reload records when callers expect stored database state.

`SharedSqliteRepository` no longer exposes a sync-wrapper helper. If a sync API
still exists for a deliberate boundary, its async equivalent must contain its own
async SQL implementation rather than wrapping the sync method.

Runtime services and repositories must not keep shallow paired methods for the
same operation. Do not add a synchronous public method and a matching `_async`
method where each one only forwards to a lower layer, for example
`get_entry()` delegating to `repo.get_by_id()` beside `get_entry_async()`
delegating to `repo.get_by_id_async()`. That pattern recreates the old split
runtime surface even when the async method itself uses `await`.

The required shape is a single runtime path. For runtime database operations,
define the async method as the primary service/repository API and migrate
callers to `await` it through the stack. A synchronous adapter may exist only at
a documented process or compatibility boundary, such as a CLI or SDK wrapper,
and it must not become a second domain-service implementation.

Async services must also stay async internally. Do not call synchronous SQLite,
network, retrieval, or LLM methods from an async run, hook, or memory path; add
or use the real async downstream API and await it instead.

Claim and queue operations must remain atomic. Each claim updates a row only
from its eligible pending state, or from a stale in-progress state, and then
reloads the same row inside the write operation. A zero-row update means another
worker already owns the item and the method returns `None`.

The terminal-view route still uses `_call_session_read("sessions.terminal_view",
...)` so it remains governed by `RouteWorkClass.SESSION_READ` admission and
load-shedding. The queued callable is async, and the route may return
`{"status": "deferred"}` when the request times out, but the marker task must
continue in the background and its result must be observed.

## Implementation Spec

### Automation Delivery Repository

`AutomationDeliveryRepository` implements these async methods with native
`aiosqlite` access:

- `create_async`
- `update_async`
- `get_by_run_id_async`
- `list_pending_started_async`
- `list_pending_terminal_async`
- `claim_started_async`
- `claim_terminal_async`
- `list_pending_started_cleanup_async`
- `claim_started_cleanup_async`
- `has_project_records_async`
- `delete_by_project_async`

Create and update write the same fields as the synchronous methods and reload by
`run_id`. Missing `run_id` lookups still raise `KeyError`.

### Bound Session Queue Repository

`AutomationBoundSessionQueueRepository` implements these async methods with
native `aiosqlite` access:

- `create_async`
- `update_async`
- `get_async`
- `has_non_terminal_item_for_run_async`
- `count_non_terminal_by_session_async`
- `count_non_terminal_ahead_async`
- `list_ready_to_start_async`
- `list_waiting_for_result_async`
- `claim_starting_async`
- `list_pending_queue_cleanup_async`
- `claim_queue_cleanup_async`
- `has_project_records_async`
- `delete_by_project_async`

Create and update reload by `automation_queue_id`. Count and readiness queries
reuse the same non-terminal status set as the synchronous path.

### Final Repository Slice

The final slice converts the remaining async methods that previously delegated
to sync methods:

- `MessageRepository` now performs append, projection, history replay, prompt
  persistence, pruning, compaction, system prompt hiding, and delete operations
  with async SQL and async timestamp sequencing.
- Runtime projection repositories perform batch reads natively:
  `TaskRepository`, `RunRuntimeRepository`, `BackgroundTaskRepository`,
  `RunIntentRepository`, `EventLog`, `UserQuestionRepository`, and
  `ApprovalTicketRepository`.
- External and gateway repositories use native async CRUD and queue operations:
  external sessions, external session bindings, Feishu and WeChat accounts,
  XiaoLuBan accounts, gateway sessions, WeChat inbound queue, and Feishu message
  pool.
- Operational stores use native async reads and writes: workspace records, SSH
  profiles, media assets, monitors, triggers, role memory, shell approvals, and
  token usage.
- Retrieval FTS paths use async scope configuration, document indexing,
  deletion, rebuild, search, and stats operations while preserving existing FTS5
  schema and ranking behavior.

### Session Terminal View

`SessionService.mark_latest_terminal_run_viewed_async()` performs the same
logical workflow as the synchronous service path:

1. Load the session and fail with `KeyError` when the session is unknown.
2. Load run runtimes and optional background task records asynchronously.
3. Resolve the latest user-visible terminal run from preloaded records.
4. Persist `last_viewed_terminal_run_id` with
   `SessionRepository.mark_terminal_run_viewed_async()`.
5. Invalidate list-session cache after a successful marker write.

`mark_session_terminal_viewed()` creates a task for the session-read queued async
operation, waits on `asyncio.shield()` with the existing timeout, and observes
deferred task completion on timeout or request cancellation. Deferred logging
covers successful completion, missing sessions, explicit task cancellation, and
unexpected failures.

## Validation Matrix

| Area | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Repository-wide bridge guard | `tests/unit_tests/test_async_wrapper_coverage.py` scans `src/relay_teams` and fails if any source file references the removed sync-wrapper helper. |
| Wrapper-free method guard | `tests/unit_tests/test_async_wrapper_coverage.py` checks migrated async methods do not call the removed sync-wrapper helper. |
| Automation delivery repository | `tests/unit_tests/automation/test_automation_repository.py` exercises CRUD, listing, claims, cleanup, project lookup, and deletion through async repository methods. |
| Bound-session queue repository | `tests/unit_tests/automation/test_automation_repository.py` covers create, update, get, non-terminal counts, readiness, waiting-result listing, claim, cleanup, project lookup, and deletion without sync wrappers. |
| Session terminal view | `tests/unit_tests/interfaces/server/test_sessions_router.py` covers timeout deferral, request cancellation, deferred result logging, load-shedding via the session-read helper, and success/missing-session behavior. |
| Service latest-terminal selection | `tests/unit_tests/sessions/test_session_auto_title.py` covers async terminal marker behavior through the service layer. |
| Type contract | `uv run --extra dev basedpyright` validates async helper and row conversion signatures. |

## Operational Invariants

- Runtime async paths must not call sync repository methods through wrapper
  helpers.
- Route timeout must not cancel terminal-view persistence.
- Request cancellation must not leave a background marker failure unobserved.
- Session-read queue admission must still apply to terminal-view marker work.
- Claim methods must be race-safe under concurrent workers.
- Retrieval FTS updates must preserve existing scope isolation and ranking
  behavior.
- The branch does not require schema or `/api/*` contract changes.

## Follow-Up Scope

AO-4's sync-bridge migration is complete for runtime source paths. Future work
should focus on reducing redundant synchronous public APIs where they no longer
serve a CLI or script boundary, and on replacing remaining management-plane
`call_maybe_async` compatibility seams with direct async service calls.
