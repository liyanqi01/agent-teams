## Overview

Memory Bank is the durable memory architecture for Relay Teams. It captures
task results, manual notes, and condensed session context as typed, tagged,
versioned entries in `memory_entries`, then makes those entries available
through search, prompt injection, and governed capability evolution.

The system is organized as three memory tiers:

```text
capture sources
-> working memory
-> medium-term memory
-> persistent memory
-> search, prompt injection, and reviewed skill drafts
```

This tiered shape lets short-lived execution observations decay or expire
quickly while useful session, role, and workspace knowledge can be consolidated
into longer-lived project memory.

The runtime no longer reads or writes legacy role-memory services. During
`MemoryBankRepository` initialization, supported legacy `role_memories` rows are
migrated into `memory_entries` and the old table is dropped. `role_daily_memories`
is also dropped if present.

## Architecture Map

Memory Bank uses tier, scope, status, source, confidence, and expiry fields to
keep memory lifecycle explicit.

| Tier | Scope | Default TTL | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `working` | workspace entry with run/task refs | 4 hours | Immediate observations from active execution. |
| `medium_term` | session/role | 7 days | Useful context that should survive a single run. |
| `persistent` | workspace | none | Long-lived facts, decisions, preferences, and role-performance insights. |

Entries move through the architecture by consolidation. Runtime task completion
creates working memory, consolidation can promote useful information into
medium-term or persistent memory, retrieval selects active entries for
Memory page search and `## Project Memory` prompt injection, and selected
entries can be promoted into reviewable skill or SOP-skill drafts.

## Goals

- Persist structured memory across runs, sessions, roles, and workspaces.
- Support Working, Medium-term, and Persistent memory tiers.
- Provide query, search, create, update, delete, and consolidation APIs.
- Inject relevant Memory Bank entries into role prompts as `## Project Memory`.
- Promote selected memory into draft skills or SOP skills before applying them
  to the runtime skill registry.
- Surface a global Memory page in the main frontend feature navigation.
- Keep session compaction separate from durable memory.

## Non-Goals

- Cross-workspace memory sharing.
- Vector embedding storage.
- Protocol-specific memory behavior in ACP, A2A, or CLI adapters.
- Reintroducing manual role-summary refresh/update/delete flows.

## Data Model

Primary table: `memory_entries`.

Tiers:

- `working`: short-lived run/task observations.
- `medium_term`: session/role knowledge that can survive a run.
- `persistent`: workspace knowledge that survives across sessions.

Scopes:

- `workspace`
- `session`
- `role`

Run and task affinity is represented by entry references such as `run_id`,
`session_id`, `role_id`, and `source_ref`; `run` is not a separate `scope`
value.

Kinds:

- `insight`
- `constraint`
- `decision`
- `failure_mode`
- `preference`
- `fact`
- `summary`

Statuses:

- `active`
- `superseded`
- `expired`

Sources:

- `consolidation`
- `manual`
- `condensation`
- `task_result`

## Runtime Flow

Task completion writes a Working-tier `task_result` entry through
`MemoryEventHandler`.

Prompt assembly queries Memory Bank through `MemoryBankService`:

```text
resolve role
-> query Memory Bank for relevant role/workspace entries
-> inject ## Project Memory
-> load and compact session history
-> dispatch to runtime adapter
```

Memory Bank is used before local, ACP, A2A, and CLI runtime dispatch. Adapters
consume the already-prepared prompt and do not implement their own memory reads.

Capability evolution is explicit and review-first:

```text
select active Memory Bank entries
-> create memory_skill_drafts row
-> inspect generated skill/SOP draft
-> validate draft structure
-> apply through ClawHubSkillService.save_skill(...)
-> reload runtime skill registry
```

No background path silently writes skills. Draft application is a user or API
mutation, and source memory metadata records the applied draft and skill ref.
The canonical flow uses the global `skill-drafts` endpoints and supports
workspace or cross-workspace source memory selection. Draft generation can load
explicit memory IDs, search by text, or consolidate eligible active memory
entries. Draft validation checks the generated skill shape before apply. Draft
apply claims the draft before writing the app-scoped skill, then the ClawHub
skill service reloads the runtime skill registry through its mutation callback.
The older workspace-scoped `evolutions` endpoints are retained only for legacy
clients.

## API Surface

Global read/search:

- `GET /api/memories`
- `POST /api/memories/search`
- `POST /api/memories/rebuild-index`
- `POST /api/memories/skill-drafts:generate`
- `GET /api/memories/skill-drafts`
- `GET /api/memories/skill-drafts/{draft_id}`
- `PUT /api/memories/skill-drafts/{draft_id}`
- `POST /api/memories/skill-drafts/{draft_id}:validate`
- `POST /api/memories/skill-drafts/{draft_id}:apply`

Workspace-scoped operations:

- `GET /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories`
- `POST /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories`
- `GET /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories/{memory_id}`
- `PUT /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories/{memory_id}`
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories/{memory_id}`
- `POST /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories/search`
- `POST /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories/consolidate`

Legacy workspace-scoped evolution endpoints remain available for compatibility
but should not be used by new clients:

- `POST /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories/evolutions`
- `GET /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories/evolutions`
- `GET /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories/evolutions/{draft_id}`
- `POST /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories/evolutions/{draft_id}:apply`
- `POST /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/memories/evolutions/{draft_id}:reject`

The frontend Memory page uses the global endpoints for browsing and text search.
Its Skill Drafts tab uses the memory-derived skill draft endpoints to generate,
review, edit, validate, and apply consolidated workspace or cross-workspace
skills. Draft generation is collection-scoped: related memories are integrated
into one or more skill/SOP drafts instead of creating one skill under each
memory entry.
The subagent memory tab uses the workspace list endpoint filtered by
`scope=role`, `role_id`, and `status=active`.

Task completion writes both a working task-summary entry and a persistent
`role-performance` insight when verification data is available. Server startup
expires TTL/low-confidence entries and rebuilds stale active retrieval index
documents. Role self-assessment reads those Memory Bank insights directly.

## Frontend Surface

The main sidebar feature list includes Memory directly below IM Gateway.

The Memory page provides:

- graphical architecture map for capture, tier consolidation, and reuse
- workspace filter
- tier filter
- scope filter
- status filter
- text search
- result list with tags and timestamps
- detail pane for selected entries, including lifecycle fields such as status,
  source, confidence, update time, and expiry
- controls to draft a skill or SOP skill from a selected active memory entry,
  then apply the reviewed draft into the app-scoped skill directory

The old subagent UI page for manual role summaries is removed. The subagent
drawer now shows Memory Bank entries only.

## Migration

Startup migration is automatic:

1. Create `memory_entries` and indexes.
2. Normalize any already-persisted `source=reflection` rows to
   `source=consolidation`.
3. If a supported `role_memories` table exists, import:
   - `content_markdown` as a `summary`
   - `performance_json` as an `insight` tagged `role-performance`
   - `assessment_state_json` as an `insight` tagged `role-assessment`
4. Mark imported rows as `tier=persistent`, `scope=role`,
   `source=consolidation`, `confidence_score=0.8`.
5. Drop `role_memories`.
6. Drop `role_daily_memories`.
7. On server start, expire TTL/low-confidence rows, then rebuild stale active
   Memory Bank rows whose retrieval index state is missing or marked removed.

Unsupported legacy table shapes are dropped with a warning because the current
runtime has no legacy reader.

## Verification

Required coverage:

- repository creates `memory_entries` and indexes
- legacy `role_memories` migration imports rows and drops the old table
- task completion writes Memory Bank entries
- role prompt injection reads Memory Bank entries
- global memory list/search endpoints work
- workspace memory CRUD/search/consolidation endpoints work
- memory skill draft APIs generate, list, get, update, validate, and apply
  drafts
- applying a memory skill draft writes a valid skill, reloads skills, and
  records the applied draft and skill ref in source memory metadata
- legacy memory evolution draft APIs create, list, apply, and reject drafts
- subagent UI no longer renders manual summary controls
- sidebar renders Memory below IM Gateway
