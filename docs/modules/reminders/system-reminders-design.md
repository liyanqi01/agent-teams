# System Reminders Design

## 1. Goal

Relay Teams needs built-in runtime reminders that turn important runtime state into
deterministic guidance for the active agent loop.

This feature covers:

- tool failure reminders
- consecutive read-only tool reminders
- incomplete todo completion guards
- context compaction reminders

The goal is not to add another user-configurable extension system. Runtime reminders
are product-owned behavior that should work without user hook configuration.

## 2. Boundary With Runtime Hooks

Runtime hooks and system reminders intentionally overlap at lifecycle boundaries, but
they own different concerns.

Hooks are external extension points:

- configured by user, project, role, or skill sources
- implemented through command, HTTP, prompt, or agent handlers
- allowed to fail, timeout, or be absent without disabling core behavior
- useful for custom governance and integrations

System reminders are built-in runtime policy:

- enabled by default
- deterministic and covered by unit tests
- stateful across a run for cooldowns and counters
- allowed to block task completion before terminal state is written

Both systems share the same message injection primitive. Hooks use it to enqueue
`additional_context` or `deferred_action`; reminders use it to inject
`<system-reminder>` messages.

## 3. Runtime Flow

The reminder pipeline is:

```text
runtime boundary
-> typed observation
-> SystemReminderPolicy
-> ReminderStateRepository
-> SystemReminderRenderer
-> SystemInjectionSink
-> active LLM loop or persisted retry history
```

`relay_teams.reminders` owns policy, state, and rendering. Execution, orchestration,
and prompt modules only report observations and consume decisions.

Reminder delivery mode and rendered text classification are part of the same
reminder contract:

- `relay_teams.reminders.delivery` owns `SystemReminderDeliveryMode`.
- `relay_teams.reminders.text` owns the `<system-reminder>` marker and rendered
  text classifier.
- `relay_teams.reminders.__init__` re-exports public reminder APIs for callers that
  need the package-level contract.
- Root-package modules such as `relay_teams.system_reminder_delivery` and
  `relay_teams.system_reminder_text` must not exist; they split the reminder
  contract away from the policy, state, renderer, and service that own it.

`sessions/runs/system_injection.py` owns the shared delivery boundary:

- `enqueue_only` wakes an already-active loop at the next safe boundary.
- `append_and_enqueue` also persists the reminder into conversation history before
  retrying a completion attempt.
- `SystemInjectionConsumer` drains queued internal system reminders, applies the
  injection classifier, emits redacted `INJECTION_APPLIED` events, and persists
  applied reminders into conversation history when a message repository is
  available.

The consumer is intentionally owned by `sessions/runs` instead of provider or
external runtime modules. Runtime adapters may choose the safe moment to call it,
but they do not own reminder policy, marker detection, queue filtering, event
redaction, or history persistence.

## 4. Delivery Boundaries

Built-in local provider execution and external agent runtimes consume the same
queued reminder primitive at protocol-safe boundaries.

Local provider execution:

- drains startup reminders before building the next prompt turn
- drains boundary reminders after tool execution and before the next model step
- applies final-answer classification so guidance reminders can be discarded once
  an answer is already ready

External ACP, A2A, and CLI runtimes:

- drain startup reminders before prompt composition so a queued
  `<system-reminder>` becomes the latest conversation user prompt
- include every applied startup reminder in the outbound prompt text when more
  than one reminder is drained at the same prompt boundary
- keep non-reminder injections queued for the normal user follow-up path

External ACP host tools also drain boundary reminders after the hosted Relay
Teams tool finishes. The bridge returns the original structured tool result and
adds the rendered reminder text to the tool result content so the external ACP
agent sees the guidance immediately after the host tool response. This keeps
tool execution, reminder policy, and ACP protocol formatting separated.

## 5. V1 Policies

Tool failure:

- triggered after a failed tool result
- deduped per run, tool name, and error type with a cooldown
- reminds the agent to inspect the error and avoid repeating the same call unchanged

Read-only streak:

- triggered after fifty consecutive known read-only tools
- unknown tools are neutral and do not count
- `shell` is not considered read-only in v1

Incomplete todos:

- evaluated only for root task completion attempts
- pending or in-progress todos block successful completion
- the reminder is appended to history and the agent gets another turn to reconcile
  persisted todo state with actual progress
- if the work is already complete, the agent should update the run-scoped todo list
  with `todo_write` before finalizing, not repeat completed work just to satisfy the
  guard
- after three reminder retries, the task returns a completion-guard assistant error
  instead of being marked complete; this reflects persisted todo state, not a
  provider/API execution failure

Context pressure:

- triggered after compaction is applied
- reminds the agent that old tool output may no longer be available verbatim

## 6. Public Interfaces

No new `/api/*`, CLI, SDK, or database schema is introduced.

Reminder state is stored through `SharedStateRepository` with run-scoped keys under
the session scope. The schema is private to `relay_teams.reminders`.

## 7. Testing

The feature is covered by focused unit tests for:

- reminder rendering
- policy decisions and cooldown behavior
- persisted reminder state recovery
- service-to-injection behavior
- shared system injection sink behavior
- shared system injection consumer behavior
- external runtime prompt-start reminder delivery
- external ACP host-tool boundary reminder delivery
- root task retry when incomplete todos block completion
