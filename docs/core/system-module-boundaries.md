# System Module Boundaries and Shared Runtime Primitives

## Purpose

The monitor/event-driven substrate adds another asynchronous plane on top of runs,
background tasks, triggers, and notifications.
To keep that expansion maintainable, module ownership must stay explicit and shared
runtime concerns must stay centralized instead of being reimplemented per feature.

This document defines the intended boundaries for the current backend and the rules
for extending event sources such as CI, PR, and log monitoring.

## Layering

The backend should keep the following dependency direction:

`interfaces/*` -> `services` -> `repositories/shared infra`

With the current layout, that means:

- `interfaces/cli`, `interfaces/server`, and `interfaces/sdk` are transport adapters only.
- `interfaces/server/container.py` is the composition root. It wires dependencies and
  may choose implementations, but it should not contain feature logic.
- `sessions/runs/*` owns run lifecycle, recovery, injection, and SSE event projection.
- `sessions/runs/background_tasks/*` owns subprocess execution and local process event
  production.
- `boards/*` owns task-board contracts, tracker adapters, board-state mapping,
  and board-controlled tools. It may project existing tasks or external tracker
  issues, but it must not own run-local todo state or core orchestration
  scheduling decisions.
- `gateway/*` owns external conversational transport adapters, provider account
  configuration, durable inbound queues, external-to-internal session mapping,
  and provider reply delivery. Provider subpackages own their own account
  repositories and secret wrappers; shared `gateway_session_service.py`,
  `session_ingress_service.py`, and `gateway/im/*` hold cross-provider runtime
  primitives.
- `triggers/*` owns external provider ingress, webhook verification, repository
  subscriptions, and provider-triggered automation behavior.
- `monitors/*` owns the event-driven substrate itself: normalized envelopes,
  subscription persistence, deterministic matching, cooldown/dedupe, and action
  dispatch.
- `reminders/*` owns built-in runtime reminder policy, reminder state, and
  `<system-reminder>` rendering. It consumes typed observations from execution,
  orchestration, and prompt maintenance boundaries.
- `agents/orchestration/delegation_planning.py` owns automatic DelegationPlanner
  planning contracts and conversion into task drafts. It must use the existing
  task orchestration and runtime role resolver paths; it must not call providers
  directly or write model-visible execution results.
- `agents/orchestration/coordinator.py` owns orchestration control flow,
  including fixed graph execution and synthesis of completed DAG results. It
  may schedule ready task nodes, but it must not duplicate task persistence,
  role resolution, or provider execution logic owned by lower layers.
- `agents/orchestration/task_orchestration_service.py` owns delegated task
  creation, dynamic DAG validation, node-id dependency resolution, role binding,
  and dispatch through the shared task execution path.
- `notifications/*` owns outbound notification delivery only.
- `persistence/*` and module-local `repository.py` files own storage mechanics only;
  they should not perform orchestration decisions.

## Shared Runtime Modules

The following modules are shared runtime primitives and should be reused instead of
reimplemented inside feature modules.

### `relay_teams.paths`

Use `paths` for app/user/project root resolution and filesystem helpers.

Rules:

- Prefer `RuntimeConfig.paths` whenever runtime has already been resolved.
- Use `relay_teams.paths` helpers for global config roots and reusable filesystem
  operations.
- Do not rebuild app config paths ad hoc with `Path.home()`, string concatenation, or
  duplicate `~/.relay-teams` knowledge inside feature modules.
- If a new stable runtime/config location becomes shared across modules, add it to
  `RuntimeConfig.paths` or `relay_teams.paths` instead of duplicating the layout.

Boundary:

- `paths` is for global runtime roots and reusable filesystem helpers.
- `workspace/*` is for per-workspace execution layout and artifact placement.
- Feature modules should not guess workspace-local directories that belong to
  `WorkspaceManager`.

### `relay_teams.env`

Use `env` for environment loading, secret-backed environment variables, proxy-aware
runtime config, and subprocess env assembly.

Rules:

- `.env` parsing, secret-backed env loading, and merged env resolution stay in
  `relay_teams.env`.
- Proxy-aware network behavior should flow through `env.proxy_env` and `net.clients`,
  not ad hoc `httpx` configuration spread across feature code.
- Subprocess integrations should request prepared env maps such as
  `build_subprocess_env`, `build_github_cli_env`, or other `env` helpers rather than
  manually stitching together `os.environ`.
- Feature modules should depend on typed config services or prepared env maps instead
  of reading raw env keys directly.

Boundary:

- It is acceptable for process-launch edges to finally hand a fully assembled env map
  to `subprocess` or asyncio process APIs.
- It is not acceptable for domain services to become the source of truth for env file
  paths, secret resolution, or proxy rules.

### Other Shared Infra

- `sessions/runs/system_injection.py`: shared system-originated message delivery for
  hooks, reminders, monitor follow-ups, and other runtime wake-up paths.
- `logger/*`: structured logging and diagnostics.
- `net/*`: proxy-aware HTTP client construction and transport policy.
  `urllib.request.urlopen` and `urllib.request.Request` must not be used anywhere
  in `src/relay_teams/`. All outbound HTTP traffic must use client instances
  created by the async factories in `relay_teams.net.clients`. The net module no
  longer exposes sync HTTP factories or sync proxy transports. Synchronous
  public API boundaries may block on async implementations, but they must not
  maintain a separate synchronous HTTP client path.
- `secrets/*`: secret persistence and masking.
- `trace/*`: trace/span context propagation.

Cross-cutting behavior should land in these shared modules when it is reused across
features.

### IM Gateway Boundary

The IM Gateway provider boundary is documented in
`docs/modules/gateway/im-gateway-architecture.md`.

Rules:

- Provider packages such as `gateway.discord`, `gateway.feishu`, `gateway.wechat`,
  and `gateway.xiaoluban` own source-native account semantics and transport
  clients.
- `gateway_session_service.py` is the only shared owner of external conversation to
  internal session mapping.
- `session_ingress_service.py` is the only shared owner of busy-session run
  handoff policy for gateway-originated prompts.
- `gateway/im/*` owns common IM context resolution and tool delivery. It may call
  provider clients through narrow protocols, but it must not persist provider
  accounts.
- `/api/gateway/*` routers are transport adapters and should delegate to services.

### Async-Only Runtime Interfaces

Runtime, service, and repository layers must not expose paired synchronous and
asynchronous public methods for the same operation. A pair such as
`get_entry()` plus `get_entry_async()` is not an acceptable compatibility layer
when both methods simply delegate to matching lower-layer calls.

Do not write shallow facades like this:

```python
def get_entry(self, memory_id: str) -> MemoryEntry | None:
    return self._repo.get_by_id(memory_id)

async def get_entry_async(self, memory_id: str) -> MemoryEntry | None:
    return await self._repo.get_by_id_async(memory_id)
```

Choose one runtime interface and migrate callers to it. For database, network,
and LLM runtime paths, that interface is async unless a documented process
boundary requires otherwise. If a synchronous public API is still required for a
CLI, script, or SDK compatibility boundary, keep the blocking adapter at that
boundary only. Do not duplicate the domain service or repository API with a
parallel sync path.

Async runtime methods must not call synchronous SQLite, network, retrieval, or
LLM helpers internally. If the method is part of an async request, run, hook, or
memory path, each downstream repository/provider call must also use its async
API so the event loop is never held behind a hidden blocking adapter.

## Runtime Injection Boundary

Runtime injection semantics are defined in `runtime-injection-semantics.md`.
The implementation boundary is intentionally narrow:

- `sessions/runs/*` owns injection queue state, API acceptance, run control, SSE
  event publication, and persisted event projection.
- `agents/execution/*` owns the timing decision for when queued injections are
  drained into model history. The execution loop must drain queued injections at
  the earliest safe model boundary: before a model request, after a complete
  tool-call/tool-result batch is persisted, or before accepting a final answer.
- Frontend code may render `injection_enqueued` and `injection_applied`, reconcile
  optimistic queue UI by `client_message_id`, and position timeline markers from
  backend events. It must not write model history, synthesize durable tool
  transcripts, or decide whether an injection entered the model context.
- Database writes for model-visible messages must flow through backend message
  repository paths only. UI compensation paths must remain visual only.

## Event-Driven Substrate Placement

The monitor substrate is intentionally separate from each event source.

Flow:

1. Event source module ingests source-native input.
2. Event source module normalizes that input into `MonitorEventEnvelope`.
3. `MonitorService.emit(...)` evaluates subscriptions and records trigger audit data.
4. `MonitorService` dispatches through a narrow action sink boundary.
5. `RunManager` and `NotificationService` consume those actions without owning source
   normalization or matching rules.

### Monitor Trigger to Agent Loop Sequence

The runtime path below is source-agnostic. GitHub webhook ingress and background-task
monitoring both normalize into `MonitorEventEnvelope` first, then enter the same
monitor-to-run dispatch path.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Source as Event Source
    participant Monitor as MonitorService
    participant Repo as MonitorRepository
    participant Hub as RunEventHub
    participant RunMgr as RunManager
    participant MsgRepo as MessageRepository
    participant Inject as RunInjectionManager
    participant Loop as LLMSession
    participant Notify as NotificationService

    Source->>Monitor: emit(MonitorEventEnvelope)
    Monitor->>Repo: list_active_for_source(...)
    loop matching subscriptions
        Monitor->>Repo: record_matching_trigger(...)
        Monitor->>Hub: publish(MONITOR_TRIGGERED)

        alt action_type == EMIT_NOTIFICATION
            Monitor->>Notify: emit notification
        else action sink bound to RunManager
            Monitor->>RunMgr: handle_monitor_trigger(subscription, envelope, message)

            alt action_type == START_FOLLOWUP_RUN
                RunMgr->>RunMgr: create_run(..., source=SYSTEM)
                RunMgr->>RunMgr: ensure_run_started(new_run_id)
            else action_type == WAKE_INSTANCE / WAKE_COORDINATOR
                RunMgr->>MsgRepo: append follow-up message
                RunMgr->>Inject: enqueue(run_id, recipient_instance_id, SYSTEM, message)

                Loop->>Inject: drain_at_boundary(run_id, instance_id)
                Inject-->>Loop: injection messages
                Loop->>Hub: publish(INJECTION_APPLIED)
                Loop->>MsgRepo: append_user_prompt_if_missing(...)
                Loop->>Loop: rebuild iteration context
                Loop->>Loop: continue agent loop
            end
        end
    end
```

Current source emitters that feed this path:

- GitHub webhook deliveries from `triggers/service.py::_emit_monitor_event_for_delivery`
- Background-task output/state events from
  `sessions/runs/background_tasks/manager.py::_emit_monitor_event`

Monitor matching and trigger audit stay inside `monitors/*`; resume, injection, and
follow-up run decisions stay inside `RunManager`.

Current GitHub monitor event names include `pr.opened`, `pr.updated`,
`pr.review_requested`, `issue.opened`, `issue.updated`, `check_run.completed`,
`check_suite.completed`, and `status.updated`.

Current placement:

- Local process output/state events are produced in
  `sessions/runs/background_tasks/manager.py`.
- GitHub webhook ingress and trigger normalization live in `triggers/service.py`,
  with HTTP transport adaptation in `interfaces/server/routers/triggers.py`.
- Run wake-up and follow-up routing live in `sessions/runs/run_manager.py`.
- Notification fan-out stays in `notifications/*`.

This keeps each module focused:

- event sources know how to ingest their own source
- monitors know how to subscribe/match/trigger
- run orchestration knows how to wake or continue work

## Monitor and Trigger Boundary Rules

The following rules apply to current and future event sources:

- `background_tasks/*` and `triggers/*` may emit monitor envelopes, but they must not
  query `MonitorRepository` directly.
- `monitors/*` must not parse GitHub signatures, read log files, or own source-native
  transport concerns.
- `interfaces/server/routers/*.py` should remain thin and only translate HTTP into
  service calls.
- `RunManager` should remain the place that decides how a run is resumed, injected, or
  followed up after a monitor trigger.
- Notification delivery should stay optional and side-effect-only; it should not own
  monitor matching behavior.

## Extending New Event Sources

When adding a new source such as CI providers, remote logs, or external delivery
systems:

1. Keep source-native auth, polling/webhook parsing, and normalization inside the
   source module.
2. Normalize into `MonitorEventEnvelope` as early as possible.
3. Emit through `MonitorService.emit(...)`.
4. Reuse shared `paths`, `env`, `logger`, `net`, and `secrets` modules instead of
   inventing source-local config/env/path helpers.
5. Do not bypass service boundaries to write directly into unrelated repositories.
6. Update `docs/core/api-design.md` and `docs/core/database-schema.md` whenever the source adds a
   new public API contract or durable storage contract.

For sources that only expose polling APIs, the polling loop belongs to an adapter in
the source module.
The monitor core should still only receive normalized event envelopes rather than
owning poll scheduling itself.

## Anti-Patterns

The following patterns should be treated as design drift:

- Reconstructing app config paths with hard-coded home-directory logic.
- Reading or mutating raw `os.environ` from domain services when `env` already owns the
  concern.
- Putting event matching, dedupe, or cooldown logic into routers or source modules.
- Letting interface layers access repositories directly.
- Mixing workspace-local path decisions into unrelated modules instead of going through
  `workspace/*`.
- Re-implementing proxy handling or secret loading in feature code.

## Current Working Model

For the monitor substrate introduced in this phase, the intended ownership is:

- `monitors/*`: durable subscription model and deterministic trigger engine.
- `sessions/runs/background_tasks/*`: local process event source.
- `triggers/*`: GitHub ingress and PR/CI-style source integration.
- `sessions/runs/run_manager.py`: wake-up/follow-up orchestration sink.
- `notifications/*`: optional operator-facing delivery sink.
- `interfaces/server/*`: transport surface only.

As new sources are added, they should fit this shape rather than introducing parallel
mini-frameworks for paths, env loading, event matching, or wake-up behavior.
