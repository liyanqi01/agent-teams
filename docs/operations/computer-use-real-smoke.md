# Computer Use Real Smoke

This feature already has CI coverage through the scripted desktop runtime. Use this runbook when you need to verify that the built-in computer tools are operating a real desktop session on Linux or Windows.

## Prerequisites

### Windows

- Windows desktop session with an interactive user session
- PowerShell available on `PATH`
- Notepad available through `notepad.exe`

### Linux

- Linux desktop session with `DISPLAY` or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` available
- Window discovery/activation:
  - `wmctrl`, or
  - `xdotool` with `xprop`
- Input control:
  - `xdotool`
- One screenshot tool:
  - `gnome-screenshot`, or
  - `grim`, or
  - `scrot`, or
  - ImageMagick `import`, or
- `flameshot`
- A calculator app available through one of these launch paths:
  - `gtk-launch org.gnome.Calculator`
  - `gnome-calculator`
  - `kcalc`
  - `mate-calc`
  - `galculator`
  - `xcalc`

The Windows backend uses PowerShell for screenshot and window discovery, plus Win32 input injection for mouse and keyboard control. It expects a normal interactive desktop session.

Windows launch resolution now includes built-in aliases for common apps such as `Notepad` / `记事本` and `Calculator` / `计算器`. Use Notepad for smoke validation because it is consistently present on Windows desktop and server images, while Calculator can still depend on AppX availability.

The Linux backend is intended for X11 or XWayland-style desktop control. Scripted CI validation remains the default because many headless or pure Wayland environments do not expose window/input automation consistently.

If your session only exposes `xdotool` fallback discovery, some native Wayland apps can launch successfully but still remain invisible to X11 window enumeration. In that case either install `wmctrl` for better discovery coverage or validate with an app that is visible to the current automation stack.

When Agent Teams launches apps through the Linux backend, it now prefers X11-compatible GUI backends by default through `GDK_BACKEND=x11` and `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`, so GTK and Qt apps are more likely to land on the automatable path when the desktop session supports it.

## Start The Backend

Agent Teams now auto-detects the host OS backend. On Linux and Windows, the real desktop runtime is selected automatically unless you explicitly force scripted validation.

```bash
uv run --extra dev python -m uvicorn relay_teams.interfaces.server.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

If you need the scripted desktop runtime instead of the real OS backend, set:

```bash
export AGENT_TEAMS_COMPUTER_RUNTIME=fake
```

Keep the existing fake model server setup if you want a deterministic tool sequence for validation.

## Browser Validation

1. Open the app in Chrome.
2. Open the role settings for the validating role.
3. Ensure the role includes at least `launch_app`, `wait_for_window`, and `capture_screen`.
4. Set `Execution Surface` to `desktop`.
5. Start a run with a prompt such as:

```text
[computer-real-validation] 打开记事本，等待窗口出现，然后截图确认。
```

6. Approve the `launch_app` action when the approval card appears.
7. Confirm that a real Notepad window appears on the desktop.
8. Confirm that the completed run includes:
   - a successful `launch_app`
   - a successful `wait_for_window`
   - a screenshot showing the Notepad window

## Expected Result

- The OS really launches Notepad instead of only appending a fake window entry.
- The run timeline contains a real screenshot from the desktop session.
- Windows screenshot observations include the virtual-screen origin so multi-monitor coordinate picks stay aligned with pointer actions.
- The `launch_app` tool result includes `data.launched_command`, which shows the resolved executable used by the OS backend, such as `notepad.exe` or `calc.exe` on Windows, or `gnome-calculator` on Linux.
